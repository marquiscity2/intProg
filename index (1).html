  <p>
JS libraries: jQuery, Lodash and JS frameworks: React and Angular.</p>
</div>  
  

<div class="sectionheading"> 5.	Differentiate javascript, typescript, transpile , ES6/7,  node. Is Node a framework? Justify your answer.  </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>JavaScript is a programming language used for web development, both on the client-side (in web browsers) and server-side (using technologies like Node.js). It is a dynamically-typed language, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime.   </p>
  <p>TypeScript: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means it extends the language with additional features and syntax. It provides static typing and compile-time type checking, which helps catch errors earlier in the development process. TypeScript is transpiled (compiled) to JavaScript before being run in a web browser or on a server. </p>
  <p>Transpile: Transpiling is the process of converting one programming language into another. For example, TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript. Transpiling is typically done to make code written in one language compatible with another environment or to add additional features to a language. </p>
  <p>ES6/7: ES6 (ECMAScript 6) and ES7 (ECMAScript 7) are newer versions of the JavaScript language. They introduced new features and syntax, such as arrow functions, classes, and the spread operator. These features are now widely used in modern JavaScript development.   </p>
  <p>Node: Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript, which allows developers to run JavaScript code on a server, outside of a web browser. It provides a set of built-in modules and libraries for server-side development. Node.js also supports asynchronous programming, which allows for more efficient handling of I/O operations. </p>

<p>No, Node.js is not a framework. It is an open-source, cross-platform, server-side runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.</p>
</div>


<div class="sectionheading">6.	Differentiate nextjs vs. meteorjs vs. expressjs </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Next.js is a React-based framework with server-side rendering and automatic code splitting, Meteor.js is a full-stack framework with real-time data updates, and Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js that is highly customizable.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="sectionheading">7.	Name 4 major differences between angular  vs. react  </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Angular is a comprehensive framework with a clear architecture that includes components, services, and modules, while React is a library that provides a lightweight approach to building UI components. Angular is built using TypeScript, while React is written in plain JavaScript. Angular uses a template-based approach to rendering, while React uses a virtual DOM and a JavaScript-based approach with JSX. Angular has a steeper learning curve due to its complexity, while React has a simpler API and is easier to learn, especially for developers with JavaScript experience.</p>
</div>


<div class="sectionheading"> 8.	What are AJAX and XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects respectively? Identify 3 properties and 3 methods    </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>AJAX is the technique that allows web pages to update data asynchronously without reloading the page, while XMLHttpRequest is the API that enables client-side JavaScript code to make HTTP requests to the server in order to perform these updates. </p>
  <p>3 Methods are new XMLHttpRequest(), abort(), getAllResponseHeaders()
and 3 properties are onload, onreadystatechange, readyState
</p>
</div>


<div class="sectionheading"> 9.	Explain npm, npx, nvm,  package.json and package-lock.json files </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>npm (short for Node Package Manager) is a package manager for the Node.js runtime environment. It is used to install, manage, and share packages (libraries, frameworks, tools, etc.) written in JavaScript.  </p>
  <p>npx is a package runner tool that is included with npm. It is used to execute command-line tools and packages that are installed locally or published on the npm registry, without the need to install them globally.  </p>
  <p>nvm (short for Node Version Manager) is a tool that allows developers to install and manage multiple versions of the Node.js runtime environment on the same machine. This is useful for testing and compatibility purposes, as different versions of Node.js may have different features and behaviors.</p>
  <p>package.json is a configuration file that is used to describe a Node.js project and its dependencies. It includes metadata such as the project name, version, author, license, and scripts, as well as a list of dependencies and their versions.</p>
  <p>package-lock.json is a file that is automatically generated by npm when a project is installed or updated. It includes a complete list of all the dependencies and their exact versions that are installed in the project, as well as their transitive dependencies. This ensures that the same versions of the dependencies are installed on all machines, and avoids version conflicts and unexpected changes in behavior. </p>
</div>


<div class="sectionheading">10.	Differences among CSS, LESS, SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet) </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet) is a CSS pre-processor, which helps to reduce repetition with CSS and saves time. It is more stable and powerful CSS extension language that describes the style of document structurally. This tutorial covers the basics of SASS.  </p>
  <p>CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the standard stylesheet language used on the web. It uses a simple syntax to define styles for HTML elements, including properties such as color, font, padding, and margin. LESS: LESS is a dynamic stylesheet language that extends the functionality of CSS. It uses variables, functions, mixins, and other features to make CSS more reusable and maintainable. LESS code is processed on the server side into CSS code, which is then sent to the client's browser.  </p>
</div>


<div class="sectionheading"> 11.	backbone, ember, underscore, bootstrap   </div>

<div class="sectionheading"> 12.	 Define the following concepts: nosql, Mongodb,  collection, document, rdbms, mysql, sql, MongoDB Query Language (MQL)  </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>NoSQL: A type of database that does not use the traditional relational database model and typically stores data in a non-tabular format, making it more flexible and scalable for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.  </p>
  <p>MongoDB: A popular open-source NoSQL document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. It supports flexible querying and indexing, making it a popular choice for web applications and other use cases that require high scalability and performance.  </p>
  <p>Collection: In MongoDB, a collection is a group of related documents stored in a specific database. It is analogous to a table in a relational database and can contain any number of documents. </p>
  <p>Document: In MongoDB, a document is a set of key-value pairs stored in a collection. It is analogous to a row in a table in a relational database, but with a more flexible schema. Documents can have different fields and data types, making them well-suited for storing unstructured or semi-structured data.</p>
  <p>RDBMS: Relational Database Management System is a type of database management system that uses a relational model for data organization and manipulation.</p>
  <p>MySQL: A popular open-source RDBMS that uses SQL as its query language. It is known for its reliability, scalability, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for web applications and other use cases. </p>
  <p>SQL: Structured Query Language is a programming language used to manage relational databases. It is used to create, read, update, and delete records in a database.  </p>
  <p>MongoDB Query Language (MQL): A query language used in MongoDB to retrieve and manipulate data in MongoDB collections. It is similar to SQL in syntax but uses JSON-like structures to query the document-oriented data in MongoDB.</p>
</div>


<div class="sectionheading"> 13.	What are data-attributes? </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
Data attributes allow us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks such as non-standard attributes, or extra properties on DOM. Any attribute on any element whose attribute name starts with data- is a data attribute.     
  </p>
</div>


<div class="sectionheading">14. Explain Media Queries and viewport and grid layout</div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Media Queries is a CSS technique that allows web developers to apply different styles to a web page based on the characteristics of the device that is used to access it. Viewport is the visible area of a web page in a web browser and Grid Layout is a CSS technique that allows web developers to create complex layouts with grids of columns and rows.</p>
</div>


<div class="sectionheading"> 15. Asynchronous, await, vs. synchronous, blocking calls vs. noblocking calls </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
 Synchronous code runs sequentially, blocking the program until each line of code has finished executing. Asynchronous code, however, allows the program to continue running while a particular task is being executed, making it useful for tasks that may take a long time to complete. </p>
  <p>A blocking call is a synchronous operation that stops the program from executing any other code until the operation is complete. During this time, the program is essentially "blocked" from doing anything else and a non-blocking call, on the other hand, is an asynchronous operation that allows the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the operation to complete in the background.</p>
</div>


<div class="sectionheading"> 16.	 What is restful services? What is restful API endpoints? What is routing? restful, restful api, restful service,  client, clean </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>RESTful services are web services that follow the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.  </p>
  <p>RESTful API endpoints are URLs or routes that are used to interact with a web application through RESTful web services. They allow clients to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on resources.</p>
  <p>Clean URLs (also known as user-friendly URLs, pretty URLs, search engine-friendly URLs or RESTful URLs) are web addresses or Uniform Resource Locator (URLs) intended to improve the usability and accessibility of a website, web application, or web service by being immediately and intuitively meaningful to non-expert users.</p>
  <p>A resource is the conceptual entity being represented by the API, while an endpoint is the specific URL used to access or manipulate that resource.  </p>
</div>


<div class="sectionheading"> 17. Fetch, ajax vs. promise, callback function, ascychronous function  </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Fetch and AJAX are methods to make asynchronous HTTP requests. Promises represent a value that may not be available yet, allowing to attach callbacks to execute when the value is available. Callback functions handle asynchronous operations by passing them as arguments to other functions. Asynchronous functions return a Promise and use the await keyword to pause execution until the Promise is resolved, making the code look like synchronous code. 
  </p>
</div>


<div class="sectionheading"> 18. Express, Express routing, express middleware   </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js, used for building server-side applications, APIs, and backend services.   </p>
  <p>Express routing is the process of defining the application's endpoints using app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete(), and other methods, and each route has a handler function.   </p>
  <p>Express middleware is a set of functions used to modify incoming requests or outgoing responses, and can be used to perform tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and more. Middleware functions are defined using app.use() or app.METHOD() methods and are executed in a specific order for each incoming request. </p>
</div>
